* InklingReader features

  In this category, possible new features are described. Feel free to implement
  any of them!
  
  - [ ] Research the 'online-mode' option
	
	In the user manual 'online-mode' is mentioned. According to the manual, 
	pen strokes can be directly received by the computer when the receiver
	is connected to the computer.

	Recording strokes from there wouldn't be too difficult, since cursor
	movement can be tracked. Storing the strokes is not a feature provided
	by the Inkling SketchManager, nevertheless it's a cool feature to look
	into.

	UPDATE: I've succesfully captured data that looks useful. Here is the
	data in hexadecimal format. The three dots indicate there were 
	multiple packets in between that contain the same data:

	02 f3 03 c2 02 09 fe 03 f2 12
	...
	02 f3 03 c2 02 09 fe 03 f2 12
	02 f3 03 c2 02 09 fe 03 f3 12
	...
	02 f3 03 c2 02 09 fe 03 f3 12
	02 f3 03 c2 02 09 fe 03 f4 12
	...
	02 f3 03 c2 02 09 fe 03 f4 12
	02 f7 03 d1 02 09 fe 03 f4 12
	02 f9 03 d6 02 09 fe 03 f4 12
	02 fb 03 dd 02 09 fe 03 f4 12
	02 fd 03 e2 02 09 fe 03 f4 13
	02 ff 03 e9 02 09 f9 03 f4 13
	02 01 04 ef 02 09 f9 03 f4 13
	02 04 04 f5 02 09 f9 03 f4 13
	02 06 04 fb 02 09 f7 03 f4 13
	02 08 04 02 03 09 f7 03 f4 12
	02 0b 04 07 03 09 f7 03 f4 12
	02 0d 04 0e 03 09 f4 03 f4 12
	02 0f 04 13 03 09 f4 03 f4 12
	02 12 04 1a 03 09 f4 03 f4 12
	
	This could be a very small part of a stroke. More testing should make
	the meaning of the packets clear.
	
	The only way to capture packets is to interface with the Inkling in a 
	special way (this basically means we need a usb device driver). We could
	see how the Windows driver interacts and mimic that.


  - [ ] Handwriting recognition
	
	The sketches can contain text. Ideally, this handwriting should be
	converted to a plain-text file, or a LibreOffice or PDF document.

  - [ ] Coloring individual strokes
	
	Providing basic editing capabilities like changing stroke colors and
	stroke thickness makes life easier for those who don't want to work
	with a full-blown editor like Inkscape.

  - [X] Make a layer a different color when the user presses the "new layer" 
	multiple times without drawing new data.

  - [ ] Give the choice for different paper backgrounds.

  - [X] Inkscape layering support
	
	As drawing is moving towards Cairo instead of a custom SVG exporter,
	the ability to store layering information got lost. This regression
	should be fixed. The code that produces Inkscape layers is still in
	the project, and it involves adding a few lines into the SVG.

	FIXED: Not using the Cairo SVG exporter, instead I improved our own
	exporter tool.

  - [X] Handle pressure data correctly.

  - [ ] Add a command-line option to disable pressure data and set a fixed 
	stroke width (possibly two options: 1. disable pressure, 2. define 
	stroke width).

  - [ ] Ability to merge files into one.

  - [X] Get all features to work on Windows as well.

	- [X] Compile for Windows
	- [X] Convert a file with the Windows binary
        - [X] Convert all files in a directory with the Windows binary
	- [X] Use the graphical user interface with the Windows binary
	      - [X] Open a file
		    - [X] Export as PDF
                    - [X] Export as PNG
                    - [X] Export as SVG
			  

** Inner working of the format

   There's not much known about the WPI data format. Below you can find what 
   we have figured out already. Feel free to add your discoveries as well.

*** Header differs per device

    It seems that files originating from different Wacom Inkling devices 
    actually have a different header. The difference starts at the 323 byte in
    the file. What this difference is, is not certain at this point. I've only
    compared data from two Inkling devices.

    The difference could be a firmware version string, or a unique device ID.
    The former would be most useful and therefore most probable. The latter 
    could possibly reveal who wrote what.

*** Blocks

    + The format seems to have a couple of 'blocks' to describe actions:
      - Stroke
      - Coordinate
      - Pressure
      - Tilt
      - New layer
